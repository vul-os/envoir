# Envoir reference web client

A premium, unified communications app for DMTAP — **mail, chat, calendar, contacts, files, and
groups on one sovereign identity**. Plain HTML + CSS + vanilla JS ES modules. **No framework, no
build step, no npm, no CDNs.** Everything is self-contained; the real cryptography runs in the
browser and everything network-facing is a clearly-labeled simulation.

## Run

```sh
cd client
python3 -m http.server 8095
# open http://localhost:8095
```

Or open `index.html` via any static server. No external assets.

## The addressing model (finalized)

The identity is always the **keypair**. What you see and give out is a **primary address**,
`name@domain` (e.g. `you@envoir.org`, or your own domain). An identity may hold **many addresses
at once** — aliases, a kept **legacy address**, an optional `@handle`, and plus-addressing
(`you+tag@domain`) — all resolving to the same key (spec §3.9.4).

The key is verified out-of-band with a **safety number** (spec §3.4): compare the words, scan the
QR-style grid, or read the digits, exactly like Signal. A blue **verified ✓** means you did this,
so a look-alike key would be caught — that's the anti-spoofing win, and why phishing stops working
when identity is a key rather than a display name. (The old client used this 8-word encoding *as
an address*; it is now correctly a verification affordance, never an address.)

## Feature set

- **Unified shell** — left rail (Mail · Chat · Calendar · Contacts · Files · Groups · Settings),
  a live **global search**, a **command palette** (⌘/Ctrl-K), and full **keyboard shortcuts** with
  a help overlay (`?`).
- **Accessible & responsive** — semantic landmarks + ARIA (dialog/listbox/status/`aria-current`),
  a single consistent **focus-visible** ring on every control, a **focus-trapped** modal that
  restores focus on close, `prefers-reduced-motion` honored throughout, and a **master/detail**
  layout that collapses to one pane (with a back affordance) from phone width to wide desktop.
- **Mail** — three-pane, conversation **threading**, folders + color **labels**, star, archive,
  **snooze**, **scheduled send**, **undo send**, drafts, rich compose with **signatures**,
  multi-select **bulk actions**, mark read/unread, per-message **verified badges**, clear
  **legacy-origin** marking, and the MOTE **3-layer inspector** as a "why this is private" drawer.
- **Chat** — DMs + **channels (groups)**, reactions, threaded replies, opt-in typing/presence
  (labeled metadata-sensitive) — the same MOTE substrate (`kind=chat`, fast tier).
- **Calendar** — month / week / day views, create event, **recurring** events, peer-to-peer
  **invitations + RSVP** (a message, not a server query), reminders, free/busy.
- **Contacts** — cards with org/title/phone/groups, gradient avatars, and **per-contact key
  verification** (TOFU-pinned vs verified via safety number), import/export affordances.
- **Files** — content-addressed, E2E, any size (drop to chunk + hash client-side), with
  **shared-folder = group**.
- **Groups** — the new concept made tangible: a group **has an address** (`team@envoir.org` /
  `@core`); create one, see its address, manage **members + roles** (owner/admin/member),
  **broadcast** (hidden list) vs **channel** (member-visible), and join policy. Sending to the
  address posts to all members.
- **Settings** — identity + safety number, **aliases** management (incl. kept legacy + @handle +
  make-primary), signatures, **vacation/auto-responder**, filters/rules, default privacy tier,
  presence + gateway toggles, **light/dark theme**, keyboard reference, recovery phrase, sign-out,
  and the **"Sign in with Envoir"** demo.

### Keyboard shortcuts

`⌘K`/`Ctrl K` command palette · `/` search · `c` compose · `g` then `m/c/a/p/f/r` go to
Mail/Chat/cAlendar/People/Files/gRoups · `1`–`7` jump to view · `j`/`k` next/prev conversation ·
`Enter` open · `e` archive · `#` delete · `r` reply · `s` star · `u` mark unread · `x` select ·
`?` help · `Esc` close overlay.

## What is real vs. simulated

| Area | Real (browser Web Crypto) | Simulated / stand-in (honestly labeled) |
|------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Identity | **Ed25519 keygen + signing** (ECDSA-P256 fallback, labeled); SHA-256 | Persistence is localStorage (a real node uses an OS keystore) |
| Safety number | **Deterministic derivation** from the public key (words + digits + grid); "recompute & verify" proves it | SHA-256 stands in for BLAKE3; 256-word list (8 bits/word) vs the spec's ~1024-word/10-bit list |
| MOTE | **Real signature** over the payload; content-address id computed | "Encryption" and the mixnet onion are structural, not performed (no real MLS/HPKE session) |
| Sign-in demo | **Real signature** over the origin-bound challenge, same key path as mail | Origin binding is the weaker in-page mode; true phishing-resistance needs WebAuthn (§13.3.1) |
| Files | **Real SHA-256** chunk/manifest hashing of dropped files | Labeled `b3:` to match the spec's BLAKE3 intent; not actually stored/replicated |
| Network | — | **Entirely simulated**: no peers, no mixnet, no gateway; delivery paths + latency + hop animation are in-memory (`mesh-sim.js`). The UI says "simulated network." |
| Mail/chat/calendar/contacts/files/groups data | — | Rich in-memory **seed data** (`seed.js`); a real client syncs these as MOTEs over JMAP + libp2p to your node |
| @handle directory | — | In-memory registry with pre-taken names + a fake key-transparency leaf |
| Aliases / plus-addressing / RSVP / group posts | Build **real signed MOTEs** | Their *delivery* is simulated |

A production client replaces `mesh-sim.js` + `seed.js` with a libp2p connection to the user's
node, compiles the Rust MOTE/MLS/identity core to WASM (the libsignal model), and binds the
sign-in origin via WebAuthn — the UI layer stays essentially the same.
