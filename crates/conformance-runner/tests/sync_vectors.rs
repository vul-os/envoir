//! `cargo test`-visible gate over the **Sync substrate** vectors
//! (`../dmtap/conformance/vectors/sync_vectors.json`, `substrate/SYNC.md` §10), executed through
//! the `dmtap-sync` reference crate.
//!
//! The counts are asserted **exactly**, in both directions: a regression in `dmtap-sync` fails
//! here, and so does an upstream *fix* to an allowlisted vector (that makes it pass, which this
//! test also notices, so the allowlist cannot rot). That second direction has now fired for real:
//! SYNC-PN-01 was corrected upstream (`SYNC.md` §14 C-02), this test failed because the
//! allowlisted vector had started passing, and the entry was deleted. The allowlist is empty and
//! all **24/24** vectors pass — 20 for the algebra; since correction C-05, `SYNC-FJ-01`/
//! `SYNC-FJ-02` for the §5.2.1 fast-join pull path; and since C-08/C-09, `SYNC-VAL-01` for the
//! full recursive `ext-value` boundary and `SYNC-SNAP-03` for the §6.1.2 op-set snapshot body.
