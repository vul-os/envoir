/// Verify a login assertion and establish a key-bound session (§13.3 step 6).
///
/// The RP reconstructs the signed preimage from **the challenge it issued** plus the assertion's
/// `cnf` (§18.9.8), and enforces, in order:
///
/// 1. `rp_origin == expected_origin` — the phishing defense. An assertion minted for another
///    origin (a look-alike site) is rejected here ([`AuthError::OriginMismatch`]).
/// 2. `aud == expected_aud` — audience binding ([`AuthError::AudienceMismatch`]).
/// 3. Every echoed field equals the issued challenge ([`AuthError::ChallengeMismatch`]).
/// 3b. The echoed `scope` equals the issued challenge's scope — the scope-elevation defense
///    ([`AuthError::ScopeMismatch`]); `scope` is inside the signed preimage (§18.9.8), so a
///    broader granted scope also fails the signature check.
/// 4. Not expired against the RP clock ([`AuthError::Expired`]).
/// 5. `from` is an `IK`-authorized signer for `pinned_ik` ([`AuthError::UnauthorizedSigner`] —
///    the wrong-identity-key / unauthorized-device rejection).
/// 6. The signature verifies under `from` ([`AuthError::BadSignature`]).
/// 7. The nonce is single-use (replay cache) — the **final** gate, so an otherwise-invalid
///    attempt never burns the nonce, and a genuine second presentation is a replay
///    ([`AuthError::Replay`]).
///
/// On success the session is bound **only** to `cnf` (proof-of-possession, §13.4) and to the
/// identity subject — nothing else.
