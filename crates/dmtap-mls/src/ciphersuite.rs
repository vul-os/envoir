//! MLS-ciphersuite PQ gating & downgrade defense (spec §5.1, `ERR_MLS_CIPHERSUITE_DOWNGRADE`
//! `0x0414`).
//!
//! Message confidentiality in DMTAP rides the **MLS ciphersuite** — a separate RFC 9420 `u16`,
//! **not** `Envelope.suite`. The §1.3 suite high-water-mark ([`SuiteRatchet`]) polices only the
//! identity / sealed-sender layer (`Envelope.suite`); a group could therefore run a **classical**
//! MLS ciphersuite while every member's *identity* is already PQ, silently leaving message content
//! exposed to harvest-now-decrypt-later even though the §1.3 mark reads "PQ." The spec closes that
//! gap by policing message-PQ on its **own** axis (§5.1), and this module implements that gate:
//!
//! - **All-members-PQ ⇒ PQ MLS ciphersuite REQUIRED.** When **every** current member advertises a
//!   PQ identity suite *and* a supported PQ MLS ciphersuite, a Commit that keeps or moves the group
//!   to a **classical** ciphersuite MUST be rejected (`0x0414`).
//! - **Per-group MLS-ciphersuite high-water-mark.** Each member tracks, **per group**, the highest
//!   MLS ciphersuite the group has used, exactly as [`SuiteRatchet`] ratchets `Envelope.suite` per
//!   contact (§1.3). A Welcome / GroupInfo / Commit selecting a ciphersuite **below** that mark is a
//!   downgrade and MUST be rejected (`0x0414`); the mark ratchets **up only**, lowering solely via
//!   an explicit member-agreed retirement Commit, never via an inbound handshake.
//!
//! The two agility axes (`Envelope.suite` via `dmtap_core::suite::SuiteRatchet`, MLS ciphersuite via
//! [`MlsCiphersuiteRatchet`]) are policed **independently** so neither can silently mask a downgrade
//! on the other.
