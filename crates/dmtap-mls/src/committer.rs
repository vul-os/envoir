//! The [`Committer`] — DMTAP's epoch-ordering seam over MLS (spec §5.1).
//!
//! MLS trusts the Delivery Service for exactly **one** thing: a *total order on epochs* — Commits
//! must be applied in one agreed order per group. On a leaderless mesh that ordering is the hard
//! part (not the crypto), so DMTAP puts a **committer** on top of MLS: the node that serializes
//! handshake messages into an **append-only, hash-chained per-group log** (§5.1). Every member
//! knows the committer; a malicious committer can *stall* but not *forge* (every handshake is
//! member-signed), and the hash chain makes a fork detectable.
//!
//! This is the lightweight **in-process** committer: an ordered log with a running hash chain.
//! It stands in for the ordering *contract* — the real mesh committer's deterministic succession
//! and full liveness timers (§5.1) are a separate concern. A member [submits](Committer::submit) a
//! Commit to get its sequence position, then all members [`advance`](crate::Session::advance) by
//! applying the log in order.
//!
//! ## Commit-confirmation quorum & self-suspend (spec §5.1, D7)
//!
//! A live but **partitioned** incumbent committer that keeps serializing Commits for a **minority**
//! of members would deterministically build a divergent log branch — healing later into a *fork*,
//! group HALT, and manual recovery. DMTAP bounds this with two coupled rules, both modeled here:
//!
//! - A committer's Commit is **`confirmed`** only once a **`> n/2` apply-ack quorum** (the §16.8
//!   roster quorum) of current members has acknowledged applying it. An **`unconfirmed`** Commit is
//!   provisional and, if later **superseded** by a quorum-confirmed Commit at the same log position,
//!   is **rolled back by its own author without raising a fork** ([`Committer::adopt_confirmed`]).
//!   A superseded-*unconfirmed* Commit is explicitly **not** the two-confirmed-Commits-at-one-
//!   position condition that is fork evidence ([`ForkEvidence`], `0x0404`).
//! - A committer that cannot observe **`> n/2` member heartbeats** within the liveness window MUST
//!   **self-suspend** — stop ordering new Commits and hold pending Proposals
//!   ([`Committer::observe_heartbeats`] / [`Committer::try_order`]) — so a partitioned minority
//!   committer stops manufacturing a branch to reconcile. Only one partition can ever hold the
//!   `> n/2` quorum, so at most one branch is ever confirmed.
//!
//! **Boundary (test double for the roster).** The in-process committer cannot observe real mesh
//! roster acks or heartbeats; those arrive as network events in a live node. This module therefore
//! models the **confirmation state machine and supersede rule** with an explicit, caller-driven
//! roster: the caller feeds apply-acks ([`Committer::record_ack`]) and the live heartbeat set
//! ([`Committer::observe_heartbeats`]), and this crate derives confirmation, suspension, supersede,
//! and fork evidence from the `> n/2` quorum. The quorum arithmetic, the unconfirmed-supersede rule,
//! and the "two *confirmed* at one position = fork" distinction are the load-bearing logic and are
//! real; the transport that would deliver acks/heartbeats is out of scope for an in-process seam.
