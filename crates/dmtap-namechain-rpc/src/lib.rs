//! Real, **network-backed** DMTAP name-chain resolvers — spec §3.12.5.
//!
//! [`dmtap_naming`] defines the [`NameChainClient`](dmtap_naming::namechain::NameChainClient) seam
//! and an offline [`InMemoryNameChain`](dmtap_naming::namechain::InMemoryNameChain) mock; this crate
//! is the **real client** behind that exact trait, so a live chain feeds the §3.12.5(b) bidirectional
//! key↔name binding that `dmtap-naming` enforces. Two chains are registered today (§21.18):
//!
//! * [`EnsClient`] — `.eth` over **Ethereum JSON-RPC**. `name.eth` → EIP-137 [`namehash`](ens::namehash)
//!   → `eth_call` the ENS registry `resolver(node)` → `eth_call` that resolver's `text(node,"dmtap")`
//!   → the classical `IK` bytes. Off-chain (**CCIP-Read / ENSIP-10**) resolvers that revert
//!   `OffchainLookup` are followed **structurally** to their HTTP gateway (see [`ens`]).
//! * [`SnsClient`] — `.sol` over **Solana JSON-RPC**. `name.sol` → self-derived Bonfida name-registry
//!   **PDA** → `getAccountInfo` → the classical `IK` bytes in the account payload (see [`sns`]).
//!
//! ## What is real vs. the live-RPC seam (honest, §6.6)
//! Everything that decides a binding is **real code, unit-tested offline against known-answer
//! vectors**: the EIP-137 namehash, the Ethereum ABI encode/decode + 4-byte selectors, the Solana
//! `create_program_address` / `find_program_address` (with the real ed25519 off-curve test), the
//! Bonfida record layout, and the JSON-RPC request/response shaping. Only the **bytes-over-TLS** step
//! is behind the injectable [`HttpTransport`] trait, so tests drive canned responses and never touch
//! the network. The single real transport, [`UreqTransport`], is a small blocking rustls client
//! ([`net`](crate#features) feature, on by default); exercising it against a real endpoint is an
//! `#[ignore]`d integration test that reads its URL from an env var — documented, not required for CI.
//!
//! ## Fail closed (§3.12.5, §3.3)
//! The trait's `resolve` returns `Option<Vec<u8>>`: **any** RPC error, malformed/absent record, or
//! decode failure collapses to `None` ("no on-chain record"), which `dmtap-naming` renders as a
//! resolution miss. The client is **read-only** (§3.12.5(c)) — a lookup issues only `eth_call` /
//! `getAccountInfo`, never a transaction — and it is only a **discovery pointer** (§3.1): the key it
//! returns is proven by the bidirectional binding and KT audit **above** this crate, never here.
//!
//! # Features
//! * `net` *(default)* — compile [`UreqTransport`], the real blocking-HTTPS transport.
