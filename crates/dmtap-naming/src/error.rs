//! Typed, fail-closed resolution errors — spec §3.3, §3.5, §21.3.
//!
//! Every variant carries its normative DMTAP error code (§21.3) via [`ResolveError::code`], so a
//! caller can map a resolution failure onto the wire error registry and the mandated response
//! disposition. Resolution is **fail-closed**: there is no variant that silently downgrades to an
//! unverified pin (§3.3's TOFU prohibition on unreachable KT), and none that "best-effort accepts"
//! a sub-quorum view (§3.5.2(b)).
