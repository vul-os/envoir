//! **Multi-resolver cross-check** — the anti-equivocation reconciliation of spec §3.12.3.
//!
//! Because **KT anchors every binding to the same key** (§3.5), the resolver types of §3.12 are not
//! merely alternatives — they are **mutual auditors**. A client MAY query several resolvers for one
//! name *in parallel* (e.g. a `name@domain`'s `dns` `_dmtap` pointer **and** a `name-chain` record
//! the owner also publishes for the same name). Since a genuine identity has exactly one key,
//! **independent resolvers MUST agree on the resolved `ik`** (§3.12.3).
//!
//! This module is the reconciliation step every resolver type feeds into. It takes the per-resolver
//! **answers** for one name and cross-checks their identity keys:
//!
//! - **Agreement** — every resolver that returned a **step-2-verified** key returned the *same* key
//!   ⇒ resolution succeeds ([`ReconciledResolution`]).
//! - **Disagreement** — two **verified** resolvers returned **different** keys for the same name ⇒
//!   **fail closed** with [`ResolveError::ResolverDisagreement`] (`ERR_RESOLVER_DISAGREEMENT`,
//!   `0x0120`, HALT_ALERT, §3.12.3): the client MUST NOT pin, MUST raise a security alert, and MUST
//!   fall back to KT-quorum (§3.5.2(b)) or out-of-band verification (§3.4.1) to decide the true key.
//!   It is **never** silently reconciled to one key.
//! - **Single resolver** — one verified answer passes through unchanged; there is nothing to
//!   cross-check.
//!
//! ## The cross-check runs only over *step-2-verified* pointers (normative, §3.12.3)
//! The agreement test applies **exclusively** to pointers that each **independently passed step 2**
//! (§3.12.1: KT verification per §3.5, and — for a `name-chain` — the bidirectional key↔name binding
//! per §3.12.5(b)). A positive answer that **failed** its own step 2 is carried as an
//! [`ResolverAnswer::unverified`] pointer and is **discarded** here: it becomes **"one fewer
//! resolver,"** **not** a "disagreeing peer." Consequently `0x0120` is raised **only** when **two or
//! more** pointers *each passed* step 2 yet resolve to **different** keys — a genuine equivocation
//! across trusted channels.
//!
//! This closes an availability attack: an adversary who can publish **one** bogus record (a stray
//! `.eth` entry, a poisoned `_dmtap` DNS answer) for a name that *also* resolves elsewhere would
//! otherwise force every client into a `HALT_ALERT` fail-to-pin — a denial of resolution. Because the
//! bogus pointer never clears step 2, it is dropped, and resolution proceeds on the surviving
//! verified pointer(s). An attacker must still corrupt **every** *verified* channel *and* the KT
//! quorum consistently — strengthening, not weakening, the anti-equivocation posture of §3.5.
//!
//! ## Abstain / unverified vs. disagree (the non-voting policy, chosen and documented)
//! Two kinds of answer **do not vote**:
//!
//! - **Abstain** ([`ResolverAnswer::abstain`], `key == None`): the resolver has **no binding** at all
//!   for the name under its type — a vote of silence (§3.12.2/§3.12.3: a name absent under one
//!   resolver type is "undiscovered by this node, not invalid").
//! - **Unverified** ([`ResolverAnswer::unverified`]): the resolver *discovered* a pointer, but it
//!   **failed its own step-2 verification** (KT / bidirectional binding). Discovery is never proof
//!   (§3.1), so an unproven pointer is discarded as unresolved under its own error — never counted.
//!
//! Concretely:
//!
//! - At least **one** step-2-**verified** positive answer is required. If **every** resolver abstains
//!   or is unverified, that is the ordinary **not-found** outcome
//!   ([`ResolveError::NameResolution`], `0x0109`) — the existing resolution-miss path, **not**
//!   `0x0120`. All-silence and all-forged are both not-found, never a disagreement.
//! - Among the resolvers whose answer is **verified**, agreement must be **unanimous**. Any two
//!   verified answers that name **different** keys are a disagreement (`0x0120`) — regardless of how
//!   many others abstained or were dropped as unverified. One attacker-controlled resolver returning
//!   a *verified-but-different* key alongside one honest resolver is exactly the split-view this
//!   catches; a merely *forged, unverified* record is not.
//!
//! This is deliberately strict: reconciliation never picks a "majority key" among disagreeing
//! verified resolvers here (that quorum decision belongs to KT, §3.5.2(b), which §3.12.3 mandates as
//! the fallback). Any inter-resolver conflict among verified pointers halts and alerts.
