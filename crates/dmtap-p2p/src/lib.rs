//! # dmtap-p2p — the real libp2p mesh transport (spec §4)
//!
//! DMTAP's `Transport` trait (defined in `envoir-node`, spec §4) abstracts *how* a sealed
//! [`Frame`] reaches a peer. The node ships two in-tree transports — an in-process fabric and a
//! raw-TCP loopback — for fast, deterministic tests. This crate adds the **real** one: a live
//! **libp2p** swarm, the substrate the spec profiles in §4.1.
//!
//! ## What is wired (spec §4.1 stack)
//! - **Transports:** TCP + QUIC, secured by **Noise**, multiplexed by **Yamux** (QUIC carries its
//!   own TLS 1.3 + streams).
//! - **[`kad`](libp2p::kad) — Kademlia DHT:** peer/record routing, modelling the §4.2
//!   `key → location` record store. [`Libp2pTransport::kad_put`] / [`Libp2pTransport::kad_get`]
//!   store and resolve a signed location record by `hash(ik)`-style key.
//! - **[`request_response`](libp2p::request_response):** the carrier for DMTAP [`Frame`] bytes — a
//!   request delivers a `(from, Frame)` unit; the response is a transport-level receipt (the
//!   DMTAP `ack` is itself a separate [`Frame::Ack`], §19.3.2, and travels back the same way).
//! - **[`identify`](libp2p::identify):** peer metadata exchange (agent/protocols/observed addr).
//! - **[`relay`](libp2p::relay) (Circuit Relay v2) + [`dcutr`](libp2p::dcutr):** the NAT-traversal
//!   ladder of §4.3 — a public node relays, DCUtR hole-punches to upgrade to a direct hop.
//!
//! ## Containing the async runtime (the design constraint)
//! libp2p is async (tokio). The rest of the node is **synchronous** and stays that way: this
//! transport spawns a tokio runtime on its own thread pool, runs the swarm in a background task,
//! and bridges the synchronous [`Transport`] trait to it over channels. [`Transport::send`] just
//! resolves the target's [`PeerId`] and hands the frame to the swarm task (non-blocking);
//! [`Transport::drain`] pops an inbox the swarm task fills. The Kademlia calls block on a reply
//! channel with a timeout. No async leaks past this module.
//!
//! ## PeerId ↔ DMTAP identity mapping (§4.2)
//! A peer's *transport address* in the node model is its DMTAP identity bytes; libp2p addresses by
//! [`PeerId`]. This transport keeps a `dmtap_addr → PeerId` book: [`Libp2pTransport::add_peer`]
//! seeds it from a resolved location record, and inbound requests **auto-learn** the mapping from
//! the frame's `from` field + the request's source peer, so an `ack` can route back over the
//! established connection without a fresh lookup (mirroring §19.3.2's "back over the same channel").
//!
//! ## Honest scope (loopback only)
//! The comprehensive test drives two real libp2p swarms on `127.0.0.1` exchanging a real sealed
//! MOTE + ack across the wire, plus a Kademlia PUT/GET. Circuit-Relay-v2 is proven for real on
//! loopback too — a reservation, then a frame delivered over a relayed connection to a peer that
//! never advertises a direct address at all (see [`tests::relay_v2_reservation_and_relayed_connection_delivers_a_frame`]).
//! DCUtR is wired and *attempts* a hole-punch automatically once a relayed connection is up
//! (observed empirically), but a genuine NAT-traversed upgrade needs two peers behind distinct
//! NATs — not reproducible on loopback, so it is an honest `#[ignore]` (see
//! [`tests::dcutr_hole_punch_upgrade_needs_real_nat_infra`]). The test suite also covers
//! connection-close/re-dial resilience, oversized-frame hardening (fails closed, no panic), and
//! large-message round-tripping near the configured size cap — see the crate tests for exactly
//! what is proven and what each honest gap is.
