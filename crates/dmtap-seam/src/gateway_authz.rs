//! Gateway authorization seam — decide whether a sender may use *this* gateway for legacy
//! egress, and record accountability. Self-host default ([`OpenGatewayAuthz`]) allows all
//! (you are your own gateway).
//!
//! This ties to the fairness/accountability model (spec §7.7, §9): a gateway attributes abuse
//! to an anonymous-but-accountable credential (ARC token / postage / operator stake) rather
//! than an IP, which is what makes a shared or open gateway economically viable. The seam lets
//! an operator plug in billing/quota + accountability checks; self-host imposes none.
