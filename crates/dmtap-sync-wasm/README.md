# dmtap-sync-wasm

**The first binding of the shared sync engine.** A `wasm-bindgen` wrapper that gives a JavaScript
product the *same compiled* CRDT algebra a Rust server runs — not a second implementation of
[`substrate/SYNC.md`](../../../dmtap/substrate/SYNC.md) that happens to agree most of the time.

This is surface #1 of the plan in [`substrate/BINDINGS.md`](../../../dmtap/substrate/BINDINGS.md)
§3. It was built first because every product that would adopt Sync already ships a JS/TS frontend
(ofisi's editor, kerf's frontend, vidmesh's `kernel-ts`), and because it sidesteps the
cgo-vs-pure-Go tension §5 flags for the Go path — a pure-Go host can later load this *same* `.wasm`
artifact through `wazero` with `CGO_ENABLED=0` intact.

---

## The proof, first

The reason to believe any of this is one command:

```sh
./build.sh                                            # compile the binding
cargo test -p dmtap-sync-wasm --test native_trace     # 20 vectors through NATIVE Rust
node --test 'crates/dmtap-sync-wasm/test/*.test.mjs'  # the same 20 through WASM, from JS
```

The JS suite drives the frozen conformance vectors
(`../../../dmtap/conformance/vectors/sync_vectors.json`) through the WASM build and asserts, per
vector, that every recomputed byte matches **both** the vector's frozen expectation **and** a trace
recorded from the native Rust engine. That second assertion is the one `BINDINGS.md` §4 calls
non-negotiable: without it, "the browser computes what the server computes" is a claim.

Current status: **20/20 vectors driven through both surfaces, byte-identical; 27 JS assertions,
7 native.** The two remaining vectors in the file (`SYNC-FJ-01`, `SYNC-FJ-02`) are §5.2.1
*transport* objects, not algebra, and are named in `NOT_COVERED` with that reason rather than
quietly dropped.

Nothing here is a mock. The vectors' `signature_hex` is reproduced by `node:crypto` signing a
preimage the WASM module hands out — which simultaneously proves the detached signing protocol
below actually works.

## Key handling: no private key crosses this boundary

**There is no entry point that accepts a seed or a secret key, and this is deliberate.**

WASM linear memory is an ordinary `ArrayBuffer`. Any script sharing the page — an analytics tag, a
compromised transitive dependency, a devtools heap snapshot — can read every byte of it, and
neither `mlock`, guard pages, nor reliable zeroization exist in that address space. A
`sign_op(seed)` convenience would take a `CryptoKey` the browser *guarantees* is non-extractable
and turn it into bytes sitting in a readable buffer for the lifetime of the tab. That is a real
loss of a real protection, bought for the price of one `crypto.subtle.sign` call.

So signing is **detached** — three steps, key never in scope:

```js
import * as sync from 'dmtap-sync-wasm';

const op = sync.encode_op(JSON.stringify({
  kind: 3, ns: 'notes', target: 'doc-1', field: 'title',
  value: { tstr: 'Hello' }, hlc: JSON.parse(clock.tick(Date.now())),
}));

const { sig_structure } = JSON.parse(sync.op_signing_input(op));   // 1. preimage OUT
const signature = new Uint8Array(                                   // 2. sign wherever you like
  await crypto.subtle.sign('Ed25519', privateKey, hexToBytes(sig_structure)),
);                                                                  //    privateKey may be
                                                                    //    { extractable: false }
const envelope = sync.op_attach_signature(op, signature);           // 3. signature IN
```

Step 3 **verifies before it returns**: a signature made under the wrong key, over the wrong
preimage, or by a custodian that silently failed cannot leave the function as a well-formed op. A
binding that emitted unverifiable envelopes would just push the failure onto some other replica's
ingest path, hours later and with no context.

The insecure path is not "discouraged" here — it is **absent**, because a documented-but-present
footgun is still a footgun. Native Rust callers keep `dmtap_sync::cose::sign_op`; they have a
memory model in which holding a secret key is a defensible thing to do. Snapshots follow the same
protocol (`snapshot_signing_input` → `snapshot_assemble`). Verification needs only public keys, so
the ingest path is unaffected.

## The API

Small on purpose: enough to replace a product's hand-rolled engine, not a mirror of every internal.
Values and objects cross as **tagged JSON** (`{"tstr":"v"}`, `{"bstr":"6162"}`, `{"int":-3}`) —
plain JSON cannot tell a string from hex-spelled bytes, and the substrate's contract is that the
bytes *are* the semantics. Everything byte-shaped crosses as `Uint8Array`.

| Area | Exports |
|---|---|
| **Ops** | `encode_op` · `decode_op` · `op_id` · `validate_op` · `op_kinds` |
| **Values** | `encode_value` · `decode_value` · `is_ext_value` |
| **HLC** | `HlcClock` (`tick`, `observe`, `current`) · `encode_hlc` · `compare_hlc` |
| **Signing** | `op_signing_input` · `op_attach_signature` · `verify_signed_op` · `decode_signed_op` |
| **Engine** | `SyncEngine`: `ingest_signed` · `ingest_ambient_authenticated` · `has_op` · `merge` · `observable_state` · `observable_state_json` · `state_root` · `verify_root` · `version_vector` · `version_vector_cbor` · `lww_cell` · `set_contains` · `set_members` · `set_surviving_tags` · `counter_total` · `counter_entries` · `death_state` · `sequence` · `tree` · `prune_below` |
| **Snapshots** | `observable_state_root` · `encode_observable_state` · `decode_observable_state` · `snapshot_decode` · `snapshot_verify` · `snapshot_signing_input` · `snapshot_assemble` |
| **Reconciliation** | `fingerprint` · `summarize` · `reconcile` |
| **Policy / GC** | `check_admitted` · `check_counter_entry` · `check_ns_ref` · `scope_to_subscription` · `stability_cut` |
| **Meta** | `version` · `error_registry` |

### Two ingest paths, named honestly

`ingest_signed(cose, now)` is **the network path**: it verifies the `COSE_Sign1` envelope, then
validates and applies. `ingest_ambient_authenticated(op, now)` applies an op whose authenticity was
already established out of band — the §5.6 profile, where ops ride unsigned inside an MLS group.
The op is still fully validated; only the signature check is skipped, because there is no signature
to check. On a multi-author or untrusted path it is a hole, and it is named so you cannot reach for
it by accident.

### Errors are codes, not prose

A thrown `Error`'s `message` is JSON:

```js
try { engine.ingest_signed(bytes, Date.now()); }
catch (e) {
  const { code, name, action } = JSON.parse(e.message);
  // → 0x0A02 ERR_SYNC_OP_SIG_INVALID FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK
}
```

`{"error":"sync"}` is a substrate refusal; `{"error":"binding"}` means the call itself was
malformed. Different bugs, different fixes — and a caller that has to regex-match prose to tell
`0x0A02` from `0x0A0A` will eventually take the wrong fail-closed path.

---

## What this does NOT cover

* **Transport.** No sockets, no HTTP, no discovery. §5.2's pull/push protocol is the host's job;
  this is the algebra and the envelope. (That is exactly why the two `SYNC-FJ-*` vectors are out of
  scope here.)
* **Persistence.** `SyncEngine` is in-memory. Bring your own store; replay or fast-join on load.
* **Identity and admission policy.** `check_admitted` tests membership in a list *you* supply. It
  does not resolve `DeviceCert` chains, namespace policy objects, or revocation — that is
  capability ①.
* **Async.** Every call is synchronous. Signing is the only step that is not, and it happens in
  your code, not ours.

## Size

| Artifact | Raw | Gzipped |
|---|---|---|
| `pkg-node/dmtap_sync_bg.wasm` | 577 KB | 223 KB |

Reported honestly rather than rounded down: **this is bigger than it needs to be.** The Sync algebra
itself is small; the bulk is `dmtap-core`'s suite-`0x02` post-quantum stack (`ml-dsa`, `x-wing`,
`hpke`) linked in because `dmtap-sync` depends on `dmtap-core` as a whole and those modules are not
feature-gated. Sync uses Ed25519 and BLAKE3 and nothing else. Feature-gating `dmtap-core`'s PQ
suite is the obvious lever and would cut this substantially; it is a change to the core crate's
public surface, so it is left as a deliberate follow-up rather than done in passing here.

---

## Packaging

`./build.sh` emits two packages from one compiled core:

* `pkg/` — `--target bundler`: ESM + `.d.ts`, the npm-consumable artifact for a web product.
* `pkg-node/` — `--target nodejs`: CommonJS, synchronous init; what the test suite loads.

Both are build output and are git-ignored (wasm-pack writes its own `.gitignore`). Consume `pkg/`
via a path/workspace dependency, or publish it under your own scope — the generated `package.json`
carries the name, version and `types` from `Cargo.toml`. The `.d.ts` is generated from the Rust doc
comments, so the types and their documentation cannot drift from the implementation.

## CI

This repository has no CI configuration (no `.github/`, no other runner), so there is nothing to
wire into. The complete gate is three commands, in this order:

```sh
cargo test -p dmtap-sync-wasm                          # marshalling-layer unit tests
./crates/dmtap-sync-wasm/build.sh nodejs               # compile to wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo test -p dmtap-sync-wasm --test native_trace      # native half of the parity proof
node --test 'crates/dmtap-sync-wasm/test/*.test.mjs'   # WASM half + the byte-for-byte diff
```

The last two are also available as `npm run test:sync-wasm` from the repo root. When CI is
introduced, that is the job.

## Adopting it

1. Depend on `pkg/` and delete your HLC, your op encoder, and your merge functions.
2. Keep your storage and your transport. Persist the canonical op bytes (`encode_op`) — they are
   the durable artifact; the engine is a fold over them.
3. Replace your signing with the detached protocol above, keeping keys in WebCrypto.
4. On join, either replay your ops through `ingest_signed`, or adopt a snapshot: verify its
   signature, fetch the state body, hash it with `observable_state_root`, compare to
   `Snapshot.root`, and only then trust it.
5. Wire `sync_vectors.json` into your own test suite. Every implementation reproduces the same
   frozen bytes; that is what makes two independently built products interoperate.
