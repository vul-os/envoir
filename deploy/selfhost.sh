# Envoir self-host — one-command bring-up wrapper around docker compose.
#
# What this does (nothing more): pick a docker compose invocation, make sure deploy/.env exists
# (copying deploy/.env.example on first run), build the node image from the real workspace, and
# start the stack in the background. It does not touch anything outside deploy/.
#
# The legacy SMTP gateway is no longer part of this stack — it lives in its own repo now
# (env-oir/envoir-gateway) with its own deploy artifacts.
#
# Usage:
#   deploy/selfhost.sh up       # build + start (default)
#   deploy/selfhost.sh down     # stop + remove containers (keeps the node-data volume)
#   deploy/selfhost.sh logs     # follow logs from the node service
#   deploy/selfhost.sh ps       # show status
#
# Read deploy/README.md first — several pieces of this stack are honestly-labelled demo/seam
# behavior (pre-alpha), not hardened self-host infrastructure.
