# Security

This page collects everything in the repository that lets you check Envoir's security claims
yourself, rather than take them on faith: machine-checked formal proofs, fuzzing of every wire
decoder, a byte-exact conformance suite, and a dedicated downgrade/fail-closed regression suite —
backed by `cargo test --workspace`, which currently runs **761 passing tests** (0 failing) across
every crate, the node, and the gateway. It closes with the honest gate that stands between this
code and any production deployment.

## Formal (ProVerif) models

[`formal/`](../formal) contains machine-checkable **symbolic (Dolev-Yao) models**, in ProVerif, of
DMTAP's security-critical ceremonies and of the group/transparency/mixing primitives they compose
— the same class of artifact used to audit TLS 1.3, MLS, and Signal.

| File | Ceremony / primitive | Properties checked |
|---|---|---|
| `deniable_1to1.pv` | Deniable 1:1 handshake (X3DH + first ratchet message) | Secrecy, injective mutual authentication (replay-resistant), weak forward secrecy |
| `deniable_1to1_deniability.pv` | Deniable 1:1 repudiation | Observational-equivalence deniability — a judge holding *both* parties' long-term keys cannot distinguish a genuine transcript from one forged by the responder alone |
| `dmtap_auth.pv` | DMTAP-Auth login ceremony | Unforgeability, replay-resistance, origin-binding (as one injective correspondence), and session key-binding (a captured assertion is useless without the session private key) |
| `mls_group_keys.pv` | MLS-style group key schedule (bounded 3-epoch instance) | Group-key secrecy, forward secrecy, post-compromise security after a combined removed-member + later-epoch compromise |
| `kt_append_only.pv` | Key-Transparency log + gossip auditor | Inclusion soundness, no-rollback extension, split-view (equivocation) detection soundness |
| `mixnet_unlinkability.pv` | One honest mixnet hop, two concurrent inputs | Passive input↔output unlinkability (observational equivalence) |

**Status: every query obtained a definitive result with ProVerif 2.05 — all security queries
hold, and the deliberate non-vacuity controls are, as intended, reachable.** Run them yourself:

```sh
cd formal
./run.sh                              # all six models
proverif deniable_1to1_deniability.pv # or invoke ProVerif directly (expect "true")
```

Stated honestly, per [`formal/README.md`](../formal/README.md): these are **symbolic**, not
computational, models — perfect-cryptography abstraction, no bit-level attacks or side channels.
Diffie-Hellman is modeled by a single commutativity equation, not X25519's small-subgroup
behavior. PQXDH (the post-quantum handshake) and the Double Ratchet's per-message healing beyond
the first exchange are out of scope. Deniability is proved **offline** only, matching the spec's
own stated limit — online (interactive, real-time-colluding-judge) deniability is weaker and not
claimed. The MLS model abstracts the real RFC 9420 key schedule to two one-way KDFs over a bounded
3-epoch, single-removal instance — not arbitrary membership sequences. The Key-Transparency model
abstracts a Merkle tree to a hash chain and tree position to a predecessor pointer. The mixnet
model covers exactly one honest hop against a passive observer — not active attacks, multi-hop
paths, or colluding hops (see [privacy.md](privacy.md) for that residual). These models prove the
*ceremonies and primitives as specified* are sound; they don't prove any particular line of Rust
is bug-free. See [`formal/README.md`](../formal/README.md) for the full, file-by-file property
statements and every one of these limitations spelled out precisely.

## Fuzzing

[`fuzz/`](../fuzz) runs `cargo-fuzz` (libFuzzer) over every canonical-CBOR **decoder** in
`dmtap-core` — the real attack surface, since every one of these functions runs on fully
attacker-controlled bytes before any signature is checked. There's one target per wire object:
`Identity`, `DeviceCert`, `RecoveryPolicy`, `MoveRecord`, `Envelope`, `Payload`, `Manifest`,
mix-node/directory descriptors, the domain directory, deniable-mode objects, capability tokens,
key-transparency proofs, plus fixed-length Sphinx cell types and DNS TXT/SVCB presentation
parsing.

Every target proves, at minimum, that its decoder never panics or hits undefined behavior on
adversarial input. The CBOR targets additionally check that any accepted decode **re-encodes to
byte-identical input** (canonical-form idempotence) — a decoder that accepts two different byte
strings as "the same" object is a real bug two implementations could silently disagree about.

```sh
cd fuzz
cargo +nightly fuzz run envelope -- -max_total_time=5   # smoke run
cargo +nightly fuzz build                               # just prove it all builds
```

**Previously-disclosed finding, now closed:** this fuzz harness's `DMTAP_FUZZ_STRICT_CANONICAL=1`
mode exists specifically because canonical-form enforcement (shortest-form integers, no
indefinite-length items, strictly-ascending map keys — §18.1.1) used to be missing at decode time
in the low-level CBOR primitive (`dmtap-core::cbor`). That enforcement is now real: the decoder
rejects all three forms explicitly, the three matching conformance cases (`DMTAP-CBOR-05/06/07`)
pass, and re-running the fuzz target with the strict flag set finds nothing over 235k+ executions.
See [`fuzz/README.md`](../fuzz/README.md) for the harness details and history.

## Conformance suite

The [conformance suite](https://github.com/env-oir/dmtap/tree/main/conformance) in the spec repo
is the **operational definition** of "DMTAP-compatible" — an implementation conforms at a level
if and only if it passes that level's `MUST` cases, not if it merely "resembles the reference." It
ships as three coupled artifacts: a normative case catalog (`SUITE.md`), the same cases as
machine-readable data (`suite.json`), and byte-exact known-answer vectors
(`vectors/vectors.json`).

- **121 numbered cases** across the conformance levels (Core, Private, Groups & Files, Legacy,
  Clients, Auth) — mirrored against the spec's own catalog of **132 registered error codes**
  (§21.3–§21.11).
- **92 execute and pass today** — 67 backed by committed byte-exact vectors (content addressing,
  the key-name checksum, safety numbers, Ed25519 sign/verify with two RFC 8032 cross-checks,
  canonical CBOR of the four core signed objects, suite fail-closed behavior, and the MOTE
  content-address + signature validation order) plus 25 more exercised directly against
  `dmtap-core`'s (and `dmtap-naming`'s) public API — including the pluggable resolver-type
  dispatch, the `name-chain` bidirectional-binding guardrail, and canonical-CBOR's rejection of
  non-shortest integers, indefinite-length items, and out-of-order map keys. Zero failures.
- **29 are skipped with a documented, per-case reason** — an exact pointer to what's missing (e.g.
  "no Profile/avatar module in `dmtap-core`," "TOFU-pin comparison is caller policy," "no
  auth-assertion module yet") rather than a silent gap — covering mixnet freshness/replay,
  MLS/group handshake bytes, key-transparency quorum, device attestation, gateway/DKIM-delegation,
  auth-assertion, alias/gateway-alias/device-sync construction recipes not yet wired into the
  runner, and push-subscription cases not yet reduced to a fixed-input known-answer test in this
  crate. `cargo run -p conformance-runner` prints every skip and its reason verbatim.

[`crates/conformance-runner`](../crates/conformance-runner) is the reference runner: it drives the
vector-dispatch loop plus a **drift guard** that fails the build if the committed vectors and what
the reference crate currently generates ever diverge. The vectors, once published, are normative —
a divergence between the reference implementation and the vectors is a bug to reconcile, not the
other way around.

```sh
cargo test -p dmtap-core   # self-checking test drives every vector + the drift guard
```

## Downgrade & fail-closed invariants

DMTAP's downgrade-resistance rules are deliberately collected into one auditable table in the
spec (§10.7), because scattering them (suite ratchets with identity, tier floors with the mixnet,
ack-before-`250` with the gateway) hides gaps — exactly two such gaps were found this way during
hardening review. [`crates/downgrade-tests`](../crates/downgrade-tests) exists solely to hold an
external integration test that drives `dmtap-core`'s **public API** against every invariant from
that table that's testable at the library level — an external `tests/` crate, not `#[cfg(test)]`
internals, so a passing test proves the *public contract* an independent implementation would
actually see.

The governing rule behind every row: **a security-relevant downgrade is either refused
(fail-closed) or an explicit, user-surfaced choice — never an automatic, silent reaction to
adversary pressure.** Examples: an unknown suite byte is rejected, never guessed; a contact's
suite can only ratchet up, never down; a `private`-tier message that can't build a path meeting
its profile's bar is held and retried, never silently sent over the weaker `fast` tier; a cold
sender's failed anti-abuse challenge gets silently dropped or deferred to a requests area, and is
never acked (which would falsely confirm delivery to an unproven sender).

This extends past the crypto layer into the two components that talk to hostile networks
directly:

- **The node's delivery state survives restart without weakening.** The per-contact suite
  high-water-mark and the outbound retry journal (spec §19.3.3, §4.4.2) are durably persisted by
  the `node/src/journal.rs` seam (a `FileJournal`, with a `NullJournal` no-op default for a node
  built without persistence) — a restarted node reloads the same anti-rollback/anti-abuse state
  rather than starting over at a weaker baseline an attacker could force by causing a crash.
- **The gateway fails closed against SSRF.** `envoir-gateway`'s outbound MX/MTA-STS resolution
  (in the separate `env-oir/envoir-gateway` repo) refuses to connect to a destination that resolves only to a
  loopback, private, link-local, or cloud-metadata address (including an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address
  judged by its embedded v4 form) — otherwise a legacy sender could aim the gateway at the
  operator's own internal network. An explicitly configured pinned address is the one deliberate,
  documented exemption.

## The mixnet anonymity simulator

[`crates/netsim`](../crates/netsim) is a deterministic, seeded model of the mixnet's
routing/mixing/cover *mechanism* — built to measure the privacy claims empirically
(Loopix/Nym-style) rather than assert them. See
[privacy.md](privacy.md#global-passive-adversary-the-chance-floor) for what it found and its
explicit "this is a mechanism model, not the deployed network" caveat.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Security reports go to **`security@envoir.org`** (see the spec repo's `SECURITY.md` for the PGP
key) or the repository's private security-advisory facility — never a public issue for an unfixed
vulnerability. Good-faith research against your own identity/node/deployment, with no access to
others' data and no service degradation, falls under a stated safe-harbour policy. There is no
pre-launch bug bounty (there's no live production target to price one against); coordinated
disclosure is the channel until one exists.

## The audit gate

**An independent external cryptographic and code audit MUST precede any production deployment.**
This is a disclosed *gate*, not aspirational box-ticking: a deployment carrying real user mail
before a qualified third party has reviewed the protocol and the reference implementation is
operating outside this project's own stated posture. Formal models, fuzzing, and conformance
testing are real, load-bearing evidence — none of them, individually or together, substitute for
that audit. Any major change to a crypto suite, the mixnet construction, or the deniable handshake
re-opens the gate for the affected surface.

Until that audit happens, treat everything in this repository as **pre-alpha** — a reference and
a proof of the protocol's shape, not a hardened mail service.
