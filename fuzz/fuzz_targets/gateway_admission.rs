/// `IdentityRegistry::admit` is called with a **presented key** and a **signature**, both fully
/// attacker-controlled bytes over the wire (a connecting SMTP client presents whatever it wants) —
/// `admit` hands them straight to `dmtap-core`'s `verify_domain`, which parses the key bytes into an
/// Ed25519 verifying key and the signature bytes into an Ed25519 signature before checking anything.
/// This is exactly the "parse untrusted bytes before any signature is trusted" attack surface the
/// rest of this fuzz suite targets, just at the gateway-admission boundary instead of a CBOR decoder.
///
/// Property checked: for ANY `presented_key`/`sig` byte strings, against a fixed challenge, `admit`
/// must never panic — it must always return one of the documented, fail-closed [`AdmissionError`]
/// variants (or, for the vanishingly unlikely case the fuzzer forges a byte-identical valid signature,
/// `Ok`), never crash or hang.
