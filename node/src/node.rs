//! The node delivery engine (spec §0.2, §2, §4.7, §19.3, §20).
//!
//! A [`Node`] is the running whole-client side: it holds an identity ([`IdentityKey`] + an HPKE
//! [`SealKeypair`]), a MOTE-backed mail store, a dedup/replay set, an outbound retry queue
//! (§20.1), and a [`Transport`] onto the mesh. It wires the shared crates into an end-to-end
//! path: resolve a recipient's keys, build + HPKE-seal a real MOTE to them (§2.4), dispatch it
//! over the transport, and — on the receiving side — run the §2.7 validation pipeline, decrypt,
//! store, and `ack` (§19.3). The sender's queue advances to `ACKED` when that ack returns.
//!
//! ## What is real vs. stubbed
//! - **Real:** Ed25519 identities, HPKE payload sealing/opening (suite `0x01`), content
//!   addressing, the full §2.7 ordered validation (via [`dmtap_core::mote::validate`]), the
//!   §20.1 sender-retry machine, dedup/idempotent ack (§2.6), and RFC 5322 projection into an
//!   IMAP/JMAP-visible [`MemoryStore`].
//! - **Real (groups, §5):** the node also holds **real MLS group sessions** (RFC 9420 via the
//!   [`dmtap_mls`] crate / `openmls`) alongside the 1:1 HPKE path — found/join a group, Add/Remove
//!   members (post-compromise security on Remove), and send/receive group application messages.
//!   Handshakes are ordered by an in-process [`Committer`] (the §5.1 DS ordering seam); group
//!   application messages ride the mesh as [`Frame::Group`]. See [`crate::group`].
//! - **Real (naming, §3):** recipient resolution is the KT-verified, fail-closed
//!   [`dmtap_naming`] resolver ([`resolve_and_pin`](Node::resolve_and_pin) /
//!   [`send_mail_to_name`](Node::send_mail_to_name)): DNS `_dmtap` → fetched `Identity` → RFC 6962
//!   inclusion/STH/leaf/quorum verification before anything is pinned — never a TOFU pin on an
//!   unreachable/sub-quorum/stale/equivocating KT (§3.3). The local `directory` is now purely the
//!   *pin cache* that verification populates; the network fetch is the `Resolver`/`KeyPackageSource`
//!   trait seam (in-memory harness where no socket layer is wired).
//! - **Real (auth, §13):** the node runs its own DMTAP-Auth login ([`login`](Node::login)) — its
//!   root `IK` signs an RP's origin-bound challenge to establish a key-bound session.
//! - **Real (deniable, §5.2.1):** an optional repudiable 1:1 channel (X3DH + Double Ratchet, shared
//!   -key-MAC) distinct from the MLS group path — see [`crate::deniable`].
//! - **Stubbed / in-process:** sender classification uses the transport return path rather than
//!   blinded tags (§2.2a); the in-tree transport is [`InMemoryNetwork`] (the real libp2p mesh lives
//!   in the separate `dmtap-p2p` crate, selectable through the [`Transport`] seam); the group
//!   committer is a single in-process ordered log (real mesh committer succession/takeover/
//!   fork-recovery of §5.1 is out of scope); timers are event-driven off an injected clock.
//!
//! [`IdentityKey`]: dmtap_core::identity::IdentityKey
//! [`SealKeypair`]: dmtap_core::mote::SealKeypair
//! [`InMemoryNetwork`]: crate::transport::InMemoryNetwork
