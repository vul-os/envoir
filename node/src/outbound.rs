//! Outbound delivery — the sender-side retry state machine (spec §4.7, §19.3.3, §20.1).
//!
//! Durability in DMTAP lives *entirely* in this sender-side queue: the mixnet/relay middle holds
//! nothing (§0.5). An unacked MOTE is retried with backoff until the recipient's `ack(id)` comes
//! back (§19.3.2) or the 72 h deadline elapses (§16.1). This module implements that machine as a
//! **total** transition function ([`OutboundEntry::apply`]) — every `(state, event)` pair is
//! either an explicit transition from §20.1's table or a rejected [`InvalidTransition`], so the
//! machine can never wander into an undefined state.
//!
//! Timers are *modeled as events* (`retry_timer_fires`, `deadline_exceeded`) rather than driven
//! by a real clock inside this type: the owning [`Node`](crate::node::Node) decides when they
//! fire (from wall-clock or, in tests, an injected clock), which keeps the machine pure and
//! exhaustively testable. The backoff *schedule* itself (§16.1) is computed by [`backoff_ms`].
