//! Sync-substrate reconciliation serving (`substrate/SYNC.md` §5.2, §5.3) — the node's optional
//! replica-sync HTTP surface.
//!
//! [`dmtap_sync`] implements the CRDT algebra, the signed-op envelope, snapshots and range-Merkle
//! reconciliation, but none of it was reachable over the wire. This module binds the four §5.2/§5.3
//! operations to HTTP, following the DMTAP-PUB gateway ([`crate::pubserve`]) exactly: an operator
//! opt-in that is **off by default**, a capability gate (`sync-1` here, `pub-1` there), a pure
//! router with the transport bolted on separately, and bounded read/write timeouts.
//!
//! Where it deliberately differs from the pub surface:
//!
//! - **Reads are not anonymous.** §5.2's endpoints mutate (`POST /sync/ops`) and disclose a
//!   replica's whole op set, so every request carries the `sync-1` capability as a `Bearer` token
//!   (§5.4: "the transport gate controls *who may sync*").
//! - **The transport is never the only authenticator** (§5.4). Every op is verified through
//!   [`dmtap_sync::verify_op_bytes`] on ingest *regardless of transport* — a valid bearer token
//!   authorizes a peer to sync, it never makes that peer's ops authentic. An op whose COSE_Sign1
//!   fails under its own `hlc.author` is rejected with `ERR_SYNC_OP_SIG_INVALID` (`0x0A02`) even
//!   when it arrived over a fully trusted link.
//!
//! Bodies are deterministic CBOR (§2.2), integer-keyed like every other DMTAP object.
