# Envoir

**Sovereign mail, chat, files & identity — your key is your identity, not an account.**

Envoir is the open-source reference implementation of **DMTAP** (the Decentralized Message
Transfer & Access Protocol): one keypair identity for mail, chat, calendar, contacts, files, and
groups, delivered peer-to-peer over a mesh and mixnet so that not even a global observer sees who
talks to whom. A human address like `you@envoir.org` is a *pointer* to your key, not the identity
itself — lose the provider, keep the key. An optional gateway bridges DMTAP to legacy SMTP so it
is useful on day one, and fades in importance as the network grows.

Envoir is to DMTAP what Element is to Matrix: the branded, MIT-licensed apps for an open protocol.

**Status: pre-alpha / reference implementation.** This is a preview build for demonstrating the
protocol end to end, not a production mail service. See [Security](security.md) for exactly what
has (and hasn't) been verified, and read the honesty notes throughout — this project deliberately
avoids overclaiming.

**No cryptocurrency, no blockchain, anywhere in this project.** The one place DMTAP admits
anything chain-like at all is an optional, off-by-default self-sovereign naming backend (see
[protocol.md](protocol.md#naming--key-transparency)) — nothing else depends on it. Anti-abuse for
cold contact instead uses anonymous Privacy-Pass-style rate-limit tokens, proof-of-work, and an
optional real-money postage stamp — never a coin. See
[FAQ](faq.md#is-there-a-token-or-cryptocurrency).

## What you get

| Surface | What it gives you | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| Mail | Three-pane inbox, threading, labels, snooze, scheduled/undo send, per-message transport-path provenance | [features/mail.md](features/mail.md) |
| Chat | DMs (deniable X3DH + Double Ratchet) and channels (signed MLS groups) on the same MOTE substrate | [features/chat.md](features/chat.md) |
| Files | Content-addressed, end-to-end encrypted, any size; a shared folder *is* a group | [features/files.md](features/files.md) |
| Identity | Safety numbers, linked devices, recovery phrase, decentralized login (DMTAP-Auth) | [features/identity.md](features/identity.md) |
| Transport provenance | Know which trust boundaries a message crossed, without weakening the mixnet | [features/transport-traceability.md](features/transport-traceability.md) |
| Self-hosting | Run your own domain, node, and optionally your own gateway — for $0 | [features/self-hosting.md](features/self-hosting.md) |

Calendar and contacts ride the same substrate as additional MOTE kinds (JSCalendar/JSContact over
JMAP, with CalDAV/CardDAV compatibility) — see [protocol.md](protocol.md#messaging--files) and
[features/mail.md](features/mail.md#calendar--contacts).

## Map of the docs

- [Getting started](getting-started.md) — build the workspace, run a node and gateway, open the client.
- [Architecture](architecture.md) — client ↔ node ↔ mesh/mixnet ↔ gateway, and where an operator's billing seam sits.
- [Privacy & threat model](privacy.md) — the honest guarantee, stated as a falsifiable claim with its residual.
- [Protocol](protocol.md) — DMTAP itself: MOTE, naming, MLS, mixnet, DMTAP-Auth, the gateway.
- [Security](security.md) — formal models, fuzzing, conformance suite, downgrade tests, the audit gate.
- Features: [Mail](features/mail.md) · [Chat](features/chat.md) · [Files](features/files.md) · [Identity](features/identity.md) · [Transport provenance](features/transport-traceability.md) · [Self-hosting](features/self-hosting.md)
- [FAQ](faq.md)
- [Contributing](contributing.md)
- [Roadmap](roadmap.md) — what's real today vs. planned.

The normative specification lives in the sibling **env-oir/dmtap** repo (22 markdown sections plus
a compiled `dmtap.pdf`), not in this repository — see [protocol.md](protocol.md).
